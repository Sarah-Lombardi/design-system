      <h1>Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Accessibility means making your website, app or service usable by as many people as possible,
      regardless of specific access needs.</p>
      <p>Making something accessible improves everyoneâ€™s ability to use a service, which is affected by
      different needs and circumstances such as location, health and equipment.</p>
      <p>Delivering accessible and inclusive services is also in line with government standards and our legal
      responsibilities for equality and accessibility.</p>
      <p>We will be adding more guidance in the coming weeks.</p>
