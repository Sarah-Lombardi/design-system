        <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/access-service-security.svg" class="confirm-desktop" alt="An example of a flow authenticating users with security codes. The flow is 2 screens. Screen 1 asks the user how they would like to receive their security code, the user can choose between receiving it by phone or email. The phone or email is already on record as part of the  service. The second screen tells the user that a security code has been sent to their phone number and asks for the user to input the security code they received.">

<!-- WHEN TO USE PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>You can use security codes or two-factor authentication to verify a users identity to let them access a service. Two-factor authentication can be used when a service stores user data and allows users to access it. Two-factor helps protect the user and the service.</p>
      <p>There are three types of two-factor authentication: something a user knows (password, pin), something a user has (phone, fob), and a biometric like a fingerprint or voice.</p>

<!-- SERVICES USING THIS PATTERN  -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Services using this pattern</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Access UK</li>
        <li>Apply for the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
        <li>Status: right to rent, right to work, view & prove</li>
        <li> Update your EU Settlement Scheme details</li>
      </ul>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      <p>More research is needed on the best way to help users access a service by authenticating them with security codes. If your service users security codes for this purpose, get in touch to share your user research findings.</p>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility</h2>
      <p>If your service uses this pattern, we’d be interested to hear any insights you have on any accessibility considerations.</p>
