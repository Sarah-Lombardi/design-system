<!-- WHEN TO USE PATTERN -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>You can use security codes or two-factor authentication (often shortened to 2FA) to verify a user's identity to let them access a service.</p>
      <p>You can use this method of authentication when a service stores user data and allows users to access it. Two-factor helps protect the user and the service.</p>
      <p>There are three types of two-factor authentication:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>something a user knows (password or pin)</li>
        <li>something a user has (phone or fob)</li>
        <li>a biometric (fingerprint or voice)</li>
      </ul>
