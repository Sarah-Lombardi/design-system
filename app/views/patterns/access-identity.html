<!-- PATTERN NAME -->
      <h1 class="heading-section">Access a service with identity documents
      <p>Also known as authenticate or identifying users</p>
      <div>
      <strong class="label--experimental govuk-!-margin-top-4">EXPERIMENTAL</strong>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">Let users access a service in a secure way by authenticating themselves with their identity documents.</p>

      <div class="example example-images confirmation">
        <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/access-service-identity.svg" class="confirm-desktop" alt="An example of an authentication screen asking users which identity document they're using. Users can select from a radio list passport, national identity card, biometric residence card or biometric resistence permit. There is also the option to see more details with an explanation of what a biometric residence card or permit is.">

<!-- WHEN TO USE PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>Follow this pattern if you are helping users access a service by authenticating users with an identity document. It could be the same document they’ve used to apply previously, the document your service has on record for them or the document that’s attached to their account.</p>

<!-- SERVICES USING THIS PATTERN  -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Services using this pattern</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Access UK</li>
        <li>Apply for the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
        <li>Status: right to rent, right to work, view & prove</li>
        <li>Update your EU Settlement Scheme details</li>
      </ul>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      <p>More research is needed on this pattern.</p>
      <p>In research, it has been shown to be confusing to users which document they should select in order to verify themselves. For example, they may have used the update your details service and not understand that they will now need to use these new details, rather than the original document they may have used to previously authenticate themselves.</p>
      <p>When using the biometric identity permit and card as one of the identifying documents, research has shown that there is the potential for confusion over which one to choose. Users tend to get confused about which document they have.</p>
      <p>Further research is needed on this. If you've used this pattern in your service, please get in touch to share your research findings.</p>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility</h2>
      <p>If your service uses this pattern, we’d be interested to hear any insights you have on any accessibility considerations.</p>
