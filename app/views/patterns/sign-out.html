<!-- WHEN TO USE THIS PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>

      <p><b>If in page, use:</b></p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>when a user comes to a certain point in your service and the most important action is to leave. This can still be used with a persistent link elsewhere</li>
        <li>At the end of a service</li>
        <li>When a user is likely to be working from a public space and is inputting sensitive data</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>If under header, use:</b></p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>When signing out of a service is best practice but not crucial for the user</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>If in header, use:</b></p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>When signing out of a service isn’t important but users might want to - for example they share a workspace</li>
        <li>This pattern is more likely to be used on multi-use and caseworking services</li>
      </ul>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
      <p>You should do research to find out at what point in your service a user will need to leave.</p>
      <p>For public-facing services it may be better to describe it as leaving a service rather then signing out. Users might not feel they have signed in to a service.</p>
      <p>Only give users the option to leave mid-service if they can save progress and carry on with the service at another time.</p>
      <p>After leaving the service, take users to a confirmation page that includes:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a confirmation that the sign out has been successful</li>
        <li>gives them the option to sign back in again</li>
      </ul>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      <p>Users are confident in using a 'leave the service' button at the end of a transaction. Users mention they want to make sure they leave a service securely.</p>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility</h2>
      <p>If your service uses this pattern, let us know of any insights you have on accessibility considerations.</p>
