<!-- WHEN TO USE THIS PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>Follow this pattern:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to find a single address</li>
        <li>to add an address manually</li>
        <li>as part of a loop to add multiple addresses</li>
      </ul>

<!-- WHEN NOT TO USE THIS PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When not to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>Do not follow this pattern:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if the address is needed as structured data</li>
      </ul>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
      <p>The postcode lookup pattern should:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>replay the address options clearly</li>
        <li>give the user flexibility to add an address in different ways</li>
      </ul>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      <p>Users living in new-build accomodation who knew their address wouldn't be found had no problem with free text input.</p>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility</h2>
      <p>If your service uses this pattern, let us know of any insights you have on accessibility considerations.</p>
