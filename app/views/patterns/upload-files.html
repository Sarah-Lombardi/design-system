<!-- WHEN TO USE THIS PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>Follow this pattern:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to add single files</li>
        <li>to add multiple files</li>
        <li>for a range of file types</li>
      </ul>

<!-- WHEN NOT TO USE THIS PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When not to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>Do not follow this pattern:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>in some internal services where there is a need for bulk uploading</li>
      </ul>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
      <p>The upload files pattern should:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>replay the file details clearly to reduce user error</li>
        <li>show the progress of an upload so users know that something is happening</li>
        <li>allow the user to skip the process if it is optional</li>
      </ul>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      <p>More research is needed. If your service uses this pattern, get in touch to share your user research findings.</p>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility</h2>
      <p>If your service uses this pattern, let us know of any insights you have on accessibility considerations.</p>

<!-- GET IN TOUCH -->
      <div class="contact-us">
       <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get in touch</h2>
       <p>If youâ€™ve got a question or suggestion share it on the Slack channel #ho-design-system, on <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system">GitHub</a> or email the design system working group on <a href="mailto:design@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk">design@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
