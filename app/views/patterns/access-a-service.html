      <p class="govuk-body" style="margin-top: -2.5em;">Also known as Authenticate or Identifying Users<p>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">Let users access a service in a secure way by authenticating themselves.</p>

      <h2 id="overview" class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Most one-time services won't need to authenticate their users. When a service does need to verify a user’s identity, it needs to balance ease of access with keeping a service and its user data secure. You should think about this early on when designing your service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You might want to authenticate users if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your service allows users to save and complete a transaction at another time</li>
        <li>a user can check the status of a transaction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Authentication is not the same as identity assurance.</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Identity assurance confirms the true identity of a user. The checks are usually done before confirming a users suitability for something. Identity assurance can consist of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>confirming the user is human</li>
        <li>confirming the validity of information and documents</li>
        <li>fraud checks</li>
        <li>checking for warnings about a user</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="variations" class="govuk-heading-m">Variations</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">There are several ways that you can help users access a service securely:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="/patterns/access-a-service-identity">identity documents</a></li>
        <li><a href="/patterns/access-a-service-personal">with personal details</a></li>
        <li><a href="/patterns/access-a-service-reference">with reference numbers</a></li>
        <li><a href="/patterns/access-a-service-security">with security codes (two-factor authentication)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can also authenticate users using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify">GOV.UK Verify</a>.</p>
      <p>Don’t use National Insurance numbers to verify a user’s identity. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud#protecting-your-service-against-fraud">Further guidance on National Insurance numbers and fraud can be found in the service manual</a></p>
      <p>You should consult a Home Office security specialist as they can advise you on the type of authentication that’s right for your service.</p>
