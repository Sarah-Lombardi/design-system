      <h1 class="heading-section">Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Accessibility means making your website, app or service usable by as many people as possible, regardless of specific access needs.</p>
<p>Making something accessible improves everyoneâ€™s ability to use a service, which is affected by  different needs and circumstances such as location, health and equipment.</p>

<p>Delivering accessible and inclusive services is also in line with government standards and our legal responsibilities for equality and accessibility.</p>
<p>We will be adding more guidance over the coming weeks.</p>
